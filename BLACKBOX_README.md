# Python Programming Interview Questions and Solutions

This repository contains a collection of Python programming interview questions and their solutions. The questions are organized by topic, and each question has a detailed explanation of the solution. This repository is intended to help junior developers prepare for technical interviews.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, open the `README.md` file in a text editor. This file contains a list of all the questions and their solutions.

## Questions

The questions in this repository are organized by topic. The topics covered include:

* **Classes**
* **Methods**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**
* **Encapsulation**

**Classes:**
1. **Question 1:** Create a Python class called `Dog` with a constructor method `__init__` that initializes the attributes `name` and `age`. Then, create an instance of the `Dog` class and print out its name and age.


2. **Question 2:** Define a class `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Create a method `calculate_area` inside the class that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. Create an instance of `Rectangle`, set its `length` and `width`, and call the `calculate_area` method.


**Classes:**
1. **Question 1:**
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(f"Name: {dog1.name}, Age: {dog1.age}")
```

2. **Question 2:**
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

rect = Rectangle(5, 4)
print("Area:", rect.calculate_area())



**Methods:**
1. **Question 1:** Write a Python class called `Calculator`. Inside the class, create methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Create an instance of the class and use its methods to perform basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Question 2:** Define a class `Student` with attributes `name` and `age`. Create a method `display_info` that prints the name and age of the student. Create an instance of `Student` and call the `display_info` method to display the student's information.

**Inheritance:**
1. **Question 1:** Create a base class called `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Then, create a derived class called `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and has an additional attribute `fuel_type`. Create an instance of `Car` and print out its make, model, and fuel type.

2. **Question 2:** Define a base class called `Shape` with a method `calculate_area`. Create a derived class `Circle` that inherits from `Shape` and has a method `calculate_area` to calculate the area of a circle. Create an instance of `Circle` and call its `calculate_area` method.

**Polymorphism:**
1. **Question 1:** Create a base class called `Animal` with a method `speak`. Then, create two derived classes, `Dog` and `Cat`, both inheriting from `Animal`. Override the `speak` method in each derived class to make the dog bark and the cat meow. Create instances of both classes and call their `speak` methods.

2. **Question 2:** Define a base class called `Shape` with a method `area`. Create two derived classes, `Rectangle` and `Circle`, both inheriting from `Shape`. Implement the `area` method differently for each shape to calculate the area. Create instances of both classes and call their `area` methods.

**Encapsulation:**
1. **Question 1:** Create a Python class called `Person` with private attributes `__name` and `__age`. Provide methods to set and get the values of these attributes. Create an instance of `Person`, set its name and age, and then retrieve and print the values.

2. **Question 2:** Define a class called `BankAccount` with private attributes `__balance` and `__account_number`. Implement methods to deposit and withdraw money, while ensuring that the balance cannot go below zero. Create an instance of `BankAccount`, perform some deposits and withdrawals, and print the final balance.



Sure, here are the answers to the programming questions along with the questions for reference:



**Methods:**
1. **Question 1:**
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y

    def subtract(self, x, y):
        return x - y

    def multiply(self, x, y):
        return x * y

    def divide(self, x, y):
        if y != 0:
            return x / y
        else:
            return "Cannot divide by zero"

calc = Calculator()
print("Addition:", calc.add(5, 3))
print("Subtraction:", calc.subtract(7, 2))
print("Multiplication:", calc.multiply(4, 6))
print("Division:", calc.divide(8, 2))
```

2. **Question 2:**
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

student1 = Student("Alice", 20)
student1.display_info()
```

**Inheritance:**
1. **Question 1:**
```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, fuel_type):
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.fuel_type = fuel_type

car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "Gasoline")
print(f"Make: {car1.make}, Model: {car1.model}, Fuel Type: {car1.fuel_type}")
```

2. **Question 2:**
```python
class Shape:
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

circle1 = Circle(5)
print("Area of Circle:", circle1.calculate_area())
```

**Polymorphism:**
1. **Question 1:**
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
print("Dog says:", dog.speak())
print("Cat says:", cat.speak())
```

2. **Question 2:**
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

rect = Rectangle(4, 5)
circle = Circle(3)
print("Area of Rectangle:", rect.area())
print("Area of Circle:", circle.area())
```

**Encapsulation:**
1. **Question 1:**
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__name = ""

    def set_name(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

person = Person()
person.set_name("Alice")
print("Name:", person.get_name())
```

2. **Question 2:**
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount()
account.deposit(1000)
account.withdraw(500)
print("Balance:", account.get_balance())

Each question has a detailed explanation of the solution. The explanation includes a step-by-step walkthrough of the code, as well as a discussion of the key concepts involved.
